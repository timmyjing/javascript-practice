// Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.
// Example:

// Input:  set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 9
// Output:  True  //There is a subset (4, 5) with sum 9.

/*

if sum is 0 return true

since all numbers are non negative, pick the numbers that are less than the sum

6
-1
5 or 2
-1
