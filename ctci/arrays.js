/* 1.1 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What
if you cannot use additional data structures?

Pseudocode
Naive Solution: Build a hash to keep track of all the counts of letters. O(n) time, O(n) space
Alternatively, can just used a nested loop for another occurence of each char. O(n^2) time
but O(1) space
